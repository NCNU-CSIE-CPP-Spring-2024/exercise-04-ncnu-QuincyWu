# Exercise03
This is EX03 for C++.  In this exercise, you will

1. Compile "ex03.cpp" with "g++ ex03.cpp -o ex03.exe".
2. Run "ls" to see a file "ex03.exe" is created.
3. Type "./ex03.exe" to see how the program runs.
4. Modify "ex03.cpp" so that it will print out "Hello, NCNU."
5. Compile "ex03.cpp" again to see whether it works successfully.
6. Commit the change in Git.
7. Run "git log" to see that you have a new commit.
